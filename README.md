# Canadian Author Finder – Chrome Extension

A Chrome browser extension that helps readers support local talent.  
When you view a book online, the extension checks if the author is Canadian.  
If the author is not Canadian, it suggests similar books written by Canadian authors, helping you discover and support homegrown voices.

Currently, the extension focuses on books, but we plan to expand to other products in the future.
